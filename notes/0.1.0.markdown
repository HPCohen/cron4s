cron4s 0.1.0 is a preview release of a fully Scala idiomatic CRON expression
parser that can be used in the JVM or in ScalaJS. *cron4s* has been designed
with extensibility in mind, meaning that it's not tied to an specific
date-time library/implementation, but provides support for many instead.

Example:

    import cron4s._
    import java.time._
    import cron4s.japi.time._
    
    val Right(cron) = Cron("10-35 2,4,6 * * *")
    val now = LocalDateTime.now
    val nextDate = cron.next(now)
