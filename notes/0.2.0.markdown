cron4s 0.2.0 is an API improvement release over the previous 0.1.0. The
list of changes in this release are:

 * Deeper Typeclass based design which has helped to make a more concise and uniform implementation.
 * Added a `Seconds` field to the cron expression and parser.
 * Added a human-friendly `toString` implementation to all the expressions and cron units.
 * Dropped support for `java.util.Calendar` as it is impossible to treat it as an immutable type and yields weird results.
 * Improved parser error messages, including the position at which the parser stopped.
 * Made `CronExpr` a proper case class with its own attributes to ease using it with serializers. Access to the `HList` is still granted with the same attribute names.
 * Deprecated the `cron4s.matcher.Matcher` and replaced it by `cron4s.types.Predicate`
 * Added a testkit module, used to test the library and useful to test user extensions.
